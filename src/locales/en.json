    "FAQ": {
      "Titel_1": "General information on the topic of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;balancing",
      
      "Frage_1_1": "What is CO<sub>2</sub> balancing?",
      "Antwort_1_1": "A CO<sub>2</sub> balance or carbon footprint is used to plot the greenhouse gas emissions of an organisation, a product, a service or an activity within a defined assessment boundary. This balance includes all emissions harmful to the climate and expresses them as CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents.",
      
      "Frage_1_2": "What kind of standards are there for CO<sub>2</sub> balancing? What is Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol)?",
      "Antwort_1_2_1": "To balance CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, there are various national standards and internationally recognised standards available. These are the GHG Protocol, the ISO standard 14067 for products and the ISO 14064-1 standard for organisations.",
      "Antwort_1_2_2": "The <b>GHG-Protocol (\"A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\")</b> is a multi-stakeholder syndicate of companies, NGO’s and governments working together under the leadership of the World Resources Institute (WIR) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The above initiative is explicitly addressing the organisation level. This Standard was published in collaboration with the industry following a worldwide practical test in 2011 and has been accessible to the public ever since. Because this Standard is practice-oriented and easy to use, it is an internationally recognised standard that is widely used in many companies and organisations. ",
      "Antwort_1_2_3": "A binding international standard for CO<sub>2</sub> balancing was published in August 2018 in the form of the <b>ISO 14067 (\"Greenhouse gases – Carbon footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for quantification\")</b>. The most important goals had been to harmonise the already existing standards, that is the GHG Protocol and the PAS 2050, in addition to developing a specification that could be widely applied. The ISO 14067 standard focuses on balancing CO<sub>2</sub> of products and services. Whereas the <b>ISO 14064 specifies principles and requirements at the organisation level for quantification, monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals<b>. It includes requirements for the design, development, management, reporting and verification of an organisation's GHG inventory.",
      
      "Frage_1_3": "What are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions?",
      "Antwort_1_3_1": "Greenhouse gases are gases in the atmospheres that cause the so-called greenhouse effect. They absorb long-wave radiation (thermal radiation) emitted by the Earth’s surface, the clouds and the atmosphere itself. Usually this radiation would be released to outer space. However, greenhouse gases emit this thermal radiation both ways, that is toward outer space and toward the Earth’s surface, thus, heating up the lower atmosphere even more.",
      "Antwort_1_3_2": "Greenhouse gases are defined to include: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O, also known as dinitrogen oxide or laughing gas), hydrofluorocarbons (HFKW), perfluorocarbons (FKW), sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>). They can be found naturally in lower concentrations in the atmosphere. Human activities (such as combustion of mineral oil, coal and gas) have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere considerably since the beginning of the last century and have been causing a steady increase of the human-induced greenhouse effect.",
      
      "Frage_1_4": "What are scopes and what emissions do they include?",
      "Antwort_1_4_1": "Scopes are specific areas of emissions. All emissions occurring there are allocated to the respective scope. ",
      "Antwort_1_4_2": "Scope 1, 2 and 3 are defined in the GHG protocol as follows:",
      "Antwort_1_4_2_1": "<b>Scope 1</b> contains all <b>direct</b> emissions originating from company-owned or controlled sources within the balancing boundaries.",
      "Antwort_1_4_2_2": "<b>Scope 2</b> are the <b>indirect emissions</b> from third-party generated, purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling.",
      "Antwort_1_4_2_3": "<b>Scope 3</b> includes all <b>other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain</b>, such as from the production and transport of purchased goods or the distribution and use of own products or the disposal of waste. Emissions from business trips are also included.",
      "Antwort_1_4_3": "These scopes can be explained easily using TU Darmstadt as an example.",
      "Antwort_1_4_4": "<b>Scope 1</b> – direct emissions originate from sources that are either owned or controlled directly by the reporting organisational unit or TU Darmstadt. They can be split into various categories. Generating electricity, steam and heating by TU Darmstadt is one category.  Another category for generating direct emissions is the production and processing of chemicals and materials as well as waste processing. Emissions that occur during the transport of materials, products, waste, and employees using means of transportation owned by TU Darmstadt are also included as direct emissions. This also includes volatile emissions that occur either by intentionally or unintentionally releasing greenhouse gases via device leaks or defective seals or gaskets.",
      "Antwort_1_4_5": "<b>Scope 2</b> – Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from purchased electricity, district heating, district cooling and steam. To this end, emissions released when generating energy purchased from third parties are calculated.",
      "Antwort_1_4_6": "<b>Scope 3</b> – Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions caused by suppliers, service providers or employees and staff. Emissions listed under Scope 3 are subdivided into upstream and downstream activities within the value chain.",
      "Antwort_1_4_7": "Upstream activities include business trips of employees and staff using third-party means of transport, commuting and emissions from delivered purchases. Downstream activities include emissions from delivering products to customers, emissions from processing intermediate products, using purchased products and disposing of waste (such as chemicals and materials collected by third parties for proper disposal).",

      "Frage_1_5": "What is “ecoinvent” and “GEMIS”?",
      "Antwort_1_5_1": "“ecoinvent” is a database and is considered the most consistent and transparent life-cycle inventory database worldwide. It supports the environmental assessment of products and processes and currently includes more than 18,000 datasets. “ecoinvent” does not only include information on CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors, but also provides general information on the environmental impact of products and services. This means that the database contains measured and modelled information about industrial and agricultural processes. The natural resources extracted from the environment by the product or service, the emissions released (in water, air and soil) and the resulting by-products and wastes are being considered as well. (Source: <a href=\"https://ecoinvent.org/the-ecoinvent-database/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> ecoinvent Database - ecoinvent</a>)",
      "Antwort_1_5_2": "GEMIS is the acronym for “Globales Emissions Modell integrierter Systeme – Global Emissions Model for Integrated Systems”. GEMIS is a life-cycle analysis programme and database for energy, material and transport systems and their impact on the environment.",
      
      "Frage_1_6": "What is a CO<sub>2</sub>eq factor and how is it composed?",
      "Antwort_1_6_1": "CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents, also called CO<sub>2</sub>e or CO<sub>2</sub>eq, refer to a unit of measurement used to compare the impact of various greenhouse gases (GHG) on the climate. To this end, the greenhouse gas impact of CO<sub>2</sub> is defined as one (1) against which all other substances are specified accordingly in an equivalent form. ",
      "Antwort_1_6_2": "The retention time of gases in the atmosphere must be considered, for instance, because it can be quite different depending on the substance. While CO<sub>2</sub> is retained in the atmosphere for several hundred years, methane has a half-life of 15 years, for instance. The concentration of the respective substances already in the atmosphere can have an impact on the determined value. Due to these complex interrelations, the value of many of these substances used in literature can vary.",

      "Antwort_1_7_1": "The state of Hesse is currently running a project that will make its administration CO<sub>2</sub> neutral by 2030 (more information about this project:  <a href=\"https://co2.hessen-nachhaltig.de/der-film.html\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Der Film (the film) (hessen-nachhaltig.de)</a> and <a href=\"https://co2.hessen-nachhaltig.de/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CO<sub>2</sub>-neutrale Landesverwaltung – Lernen und Handeln für unsere Zukunft (CO<sub>2</sub> neutrale state administration – learning and acting with our future in mind) (hessen-nachhaltig.de)</a>).",
      "Antwort_1_7_2": "To date, TU Darmstadt has not published an overall CO<sub>2</sub> balance. The Energy Management unit of TU Darmstadt has been generating GHG sub-balances for Hochschul-Informations-System GmbH (HIS) since 2008 to accommodate the state of Hesse’s aim to have a \"CO<sub>2</sub> neutral state administration by 2030\". Generating an annual, comprehensive CO<sub>2</sub> balance is an important step towards a climate-neutral higher education institution.",
      
      
      "Titel_2": "General information on the web-based calculator of TU Darmstadt",
      
      "Frage_2_1": "What is the primary purpose of the calculator?",
      "Antwort_2_1": "The primary purpose of the calculator is to help organisational units of TU Darmstadt with the annual CO<sub>2</sub> balancing. The calculator serves as a monitoring tool for the organisational units. By using the calculator, the organisational units of TU Darmstadt not only become more aware of their yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but will also notice a trend of their development over time. ",
      
      "Frage_2_2": "What standard is the calculator based on?",
      "Antwort_2_2": "The calculator is based on the greenhouse gas protocol (GHG protocol).",
      
      "Frage_2_3": "What emissions are considered by the calculator and why?",
      "Antwort_2_3_1": "The calculator determines emissions based on consumption (electricity, heating and cooling) regarding buildings, IT devices, commuting distance of employees and their business trips. ",
      "Antwort_2_3_2": "As a result of an analysis of primary sources of emission at various universities and institutes (University of Klagenfurt, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna), Directorate V (Building Management & Technical Operations) of TU Darmstadt and the Institute for Fluid System Technology (FST)), it was determined that these emission categories capture and cover more than 90% of the generated emissions.

      "Frage_2_4": "Where do the CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors come from that are used for balancing?",
      "Antwort_2_4": "There are private databases such as ecoinvent and public databases such as GEMIS that provide CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors and update their data regularly based on new calculating methods and knowledge. The CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors used for balancing at TU Darmstadt have all been taken from the ecoinvent and GEMIS databases. In addition, the web-based calculator uses CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors for electricity that are being calculated by the Energy Management unit of TU Darmstadt or originate from third-party electricity contracts. The CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors for heating are also made available by the Energy Management unit.",

      "Antwort_2_6_2": "Uncertainties occur when projecting actual calculations based on the results of a survey that has not been taken by all employees. Emission generated by multiple organisational units consuming energy can only be approximated because energy consumption is not measured for each organisational unit individually. The calculations are based on the average energy consumption of the building.",
      "Antwort_2_6_3": "In addition, uncertainties occur when specifying the CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors. This can be illustrated using the example of a business trip by plane. The energy consumption of a plane depends on the type of plane. The CO<sub>2</sub>eq factors of a Boeing 777 or an Airbus A320 differ due to their unladen weight, the number of passengers etc. The databases, however, provide average values for the type of plane.",
      
      "Frage_2_7": "Will these results be published?",
      "Antwort_2_7": "Results of a single person will not be published; and if the user does not have an account, they cannot be allocated to a specific person. Hence, only results of organisational units of TU Darmstadt will be published. ",
      
      "Frage_2_8": "What ideas are there for further development?",
      "Antwort_2_8_1": "Ideas for further development with regard to content extend the range of emissions to include such as staying in a hotel overnight during business trips, duration of the business trip and the consumption of paper within the organisational units. A major extension is adding hangars, halls, shop floors and laboratories including the materials consumed and produced there by the organisational units. This way the organisational units can use the CO<sub>2</sub> calculator in future for balancing. ",
      "Antwort_2_8_2": "Regarding IT infrastructure, topics such as more powerful servers and introducing / upgrading interfaces to other systems to simplify data management will be developed further in future. ",

      "Frage_3_1": "How can I balance CO<sub>2</sub> for my organisational unit?",
      "Antwort_3_1_1": "1. Logging in via SSO of TU Darmstadt",
      "Antwort_3_1_1_1": "You must log in via SSO of TU Darmstadt to be able to use the CO<sub>2</sub> calculator.",
      "Antwort_3_1_2": "2. Preparing a survey",
      "Antwort_3_1_2_1": "After logging in, you will be forwarded to the page where you can prepare a survey (\"<i>CO<sub>2</sub> calculator</i>\" in the tab bar). Here you can create a survey for your organisational unit by completing the entry fields. This is the general part of the survey, also called the main survey. General information about the organisational unit of TU Darmstadt are being collected in the main survey, such as number of employees and buildings that the organisational unit uses.",
      "Antwort_3_1_2_2": "After completing the main survey, click on the \"<i>Save survey & generate link</i>\" button. The information entered will be saved and a link for accessing the specific part of the survey, the so-called survey for employees, is being generated.",
      "Antwort_3_1_3": "3. Completing the survey for employees",
      "Antwort_3_1_3_1": "Now send the link to the specific part of the survey to all employees for completion. Each employee will then be able to individually complete this part of the survey and all entries will be anonymised. A log-in to this part of the survey will not be required.",
      "Antwort_3_1_3_2": "The survey for employees asks for information on commuting, business trips and individually used IT devices. After completing the survey for employees, the information entered will be saved using the \"<i>Send</i>\" button.",
      "Antwort_3_1_4": "4. Retrieving the results",
      "Antwort_3_1_4_1": "The results of the survey can be retrieved by going to the \"<i>Survey overview</i>\" tab. Here you can see all surveys that you have created and you can see how many employees have already completed it. You can also view, edit and duplicate the main survey (without the specific part for employees) and delete the entire survey (general and specific part).",
      "Antwort_3_1_4_2": "In addition, you can trigger an analysis of the survey. During the analysis, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be calculated and displayed graphically.",
      "Antwort_3_1_5": "5. Discussing/distributing the results",
      "Antwort_3_1_5_1": "The analysis of the survey can be shared with the employees via a link. In addition, the results can be downloaded as an Excel file, to reuse the exact results as necessary.",
      
      "Frage_3_2": "Why should your organisational unit balance CO<sub>2</sub> and use the web-based CO<sub>2</sub> calculator to do it?",
      "Antwort_3_2_1": "The web-based CO<sub>2</sub> calculator can be used as a monitoring tool. Your organisational unit can use these results to gain a summarised view of the amount of annual emissions and their breakdown into various categories. Over time, you can monitor if and by how much the emissions of your organisational unit will have decreased. ",
      "Antwort_3_2_2": "Should you need additional help in developing reduction strategies for your organisational unit, please do not hesitate to contact us: ",
      
      "Frage_3_3": "How much time does each employee have to spend on this?",
      "Antwort_3_3_1": "There is no simple answer to this question. You need to distinguish between the main person responsible for this and the individual employees. ",
      "Antwort_3_3_2": "The main person responsible enters the general information for the organisational unit: In which building does the organisational unit reside, how many employees and jointly usable IT devices does it have? Are these data saved, does the person responsible receive a pre-formulated email with a link to be sent to all employees? With the link, employees get access to the survey. ",
      "Antwort_3_3_3": "This survey asks for information regarding the commuting distance, the business trips taken and the IT devices used as part of the employee’s activity at TU Darmstadt). ",
      "Antwort_3_3_4": "The following video introduces the CO<sub>2</sub> calculator and demonstrates by example how to do the survey (both for the person responsible and for the respective employees). ",
      
      "Frage_3_4": "What happens if some of the employees do not complete the survey?",
      "Antwort_3_4": "In case some employees of the organisational unit of TU Darmstadt do not complete the survey for employees, a projection is calculated for the organisational unit. From the information and data captured in the completed survey for employees of your organisational unit, an average value of emissions per person is determined. This average value is then used for the employees of your organisational unit who did not complete the survey. ",
      
      "Frage_3_5": "Why are no emissions from energy consumption (electricity, heating, cooling) shown for the building where my organisational unit resides?",
      "Antwort_3_5": "The digital meters to measure electrical, heating and cooling energy consumed are (not) yet available across all of TU Darmstadt. This means that the meters either need to be read manually or simply do not exist. Therefore there is no precise consumption for individual buildings available that the calculator and the Energy Management unit of TU Darmstadt can use.  At Campus Lichtwiese, the meter infrastructure is already available. The Energy Management unit is currently expanding the meter infrastructure to make a digital capture of the energy consumption in all buildings of TU Darmstadt possible.",
      
      "Frage_3_6": "What happens with the data that I entered? Where are my data saved?",
      "Antwort_3_6_1": "The CO<sub>2</sub> calculator conforms to the data protection guidelines of TU Darmstadt (for more information, refer to: <a href=\"https://www.co2-rechner.tu-darmstadt.de/#/datenschutz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TU-Darmstadt CO<sub>2</sub>-Rechner</a>).",
      "Antwort_3_6_2": "The data are saved in a database located on a V server that is run and administrated by the University IT-Service and Computing Centre (HRZ). Information on V servers is provided here by the HRZ: <a href=\"https://www.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/services/it_services/vm/index.en.jsp\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">V-Server</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/services/it_services/vm/vm_ausstattung/serverraum/index.en.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">server room</a>.",
      
      "Frage_3_7": "Is it possible for employees who used the calculator to delete all their data from the calculator independently?",
      "Antwort_3_7_1": "Users with an account can delete surveys created by you individually. They can delete the entire user account with all surveys independently, too.",
      "Antwort_3_7_2": "Completed surveys for employees cannot be deleted individually because the data entered have been anonymised for retention and consequently cannot be allocated to a specific person. Completed surveys for employees are being deleted if the entire survey is being deleted."
